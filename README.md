Housing Price Prediction

This was an ML project where i used regression to predict the housing prices using a 1990 california housing price dataset

This project was in accordance with the book - Hands-On Machine Learning by Aurelien Geron

I used many strategies to build a reasonably strong model to predict the housing prices with all the features provided and adding additional features making use of feature engineering.

The data was not clean, hence took me a handful amount of time on data pre processing.

Here's a list of things i learnt with this project that i had no strong knowledge of :
- Feature engineering
- Stratified train-test split
- Setting up pipelines
- Different regression techniques and models
- hyper-parameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV
