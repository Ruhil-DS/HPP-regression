Housing Price Prediction

this was an ML project where i used regression to predict the housing prices using a 1990 california housing price dataset

this project was in accordance to the book - Hands-On Machine Learning by Aurelien Geron

I used many strategies to build a reasonably strong model to predict the housing prices with all the features provided and adding additional features using feature engineering.

the data was not clean, hence took me a handful of time on data pre processing.

here's a list of things i learnt with this project that i had no strong knowledge of :
- feature engineering
- stratified train-test split
- setting up pipelines
- different regression techniques and models
- hyper-parameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV
